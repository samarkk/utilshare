hello
in a gitbash terminal issue this
while(true);do git pull;sleep 2;done
open windows terminal
and in one tab cd \vagpg\centoshbase
vagrant up admin master node1 node2
then
vagrant ssh admin
in another tabl
vagrant ssh master
in the master tab do
less /home/vagrant/hadoop/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml
and then after that check hdfs-site.xml+
before starting hdfs lets' verify networking between the machines
on master do
nc -zv admin 22
nc -zv node1 22
nc -zv node2 22
thsn let us start hdfs
the HADOOP_CONF_DIR variable was set up wrongly as /home/vagrant/etc/hadoop instead of /home/vagrant/hadoop/etc/hadoop
we ahve to fix that on all the machiens 
so from master execute these four commands


 sed  -i s#/home/vagrant/etc/hadoop#/home/vagrant/hadoop/etc/hadoop# /home/vagrant/.bashrc
 ssh node1 sed  -i s#/home/vagrant/etc/hadoop#/home/vagrant/hadoop/etc/hadoop# /home/vagrant/.bashrc
 ssh node2 sed  -i s#/home/vagrant/etc/hadoop#/home/vagrant/hadoop/etc/hadoop# /home/vagrant/.bashrc
 source /home/vagrant/.bashrc
 and after that start hdfs 
 /home/vagrant/hadoop/sbin/start-dfs.sh
